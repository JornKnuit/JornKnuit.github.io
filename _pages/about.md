I am currently a PhD Candidate at the [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development), which is part of Utrecht University. Here I am part of the Land Use and Biodiversity group.

My PhD project is part of [ReGeNL](https://regenl.nl), a transdisciplinary research programme which aims to develop a futureproof agricultural sector in the Netherlands. Within my project, I aim to investigate the effects of regenerative agricultural practices on aboveground biodiversity. I will be working with state-of-the-art monitoring technologies, in order to be able to monitor plant, insect, and bird diversity across a large number of farms across the Netherlands.

Background
======
Before starting my PhD, I completed my BSc in Biology and MSc in Environmental Biology at Utrecht University. During my BSc, I specialised in ecology, evolutionary biology, behavioural biology, and theoretical biology. I developed a keen interest in modelling and computational approaches, mainly to solve ecological problems. During my MSc, I further developed this interest through several research projects. While my MSc projects were varied, overarching themes were restoration ecology, landscape ecology, and a modelling approach.
