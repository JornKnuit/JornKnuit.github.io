I am currently a PhD Candidate at the [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development), which is part of Utrecht University. Here I am part of the Land Use and Biodiversity group.

My PhD project is part of [ReGeNL](https://regenl.nl), a transdisciplinary research programme which aims to develop a futureproof agricultural sector in the Netherlands. Within my project, I aim to investigate the effects of regenerative agricultural practices on aboveground biodiversity. I will be working with state-of-the-art monitoring technologies, in order to be able to monitor plant, insect, and bird diversity across a large number of farms across the Netherlands.
